# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This code is mostly a demo for my purposes. I wouldn't say any versions are supported (and remember I'm a PM). That said, if you find a security issue I would love to know about it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find an exploitable vulnerability, then please drop me a line martinwoodward@github.com and prefix your subject "Security:" 

If you see some ways I can make the security better or show best practices as part of this sample then please [create an issue](https://github.com/martinwoodward/dotnetweb/issues).  Even better you can [send me a PR](https://github.com/martinwoodward/dotnetweb/pulls) showing me what to do.

Thanks!
